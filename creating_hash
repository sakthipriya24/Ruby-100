--> A Ruby hash is a collection of unique keys and their values. 
--> They are similar to arrays but array use integer as an index and hash use any object type. 
--> They are also called associative arrays, dictionaries or maps.
--> If a hash is accessed with a key that does not exist, the method will return nil.
